Hello, 

This my first own working repository. I have created folder called Git-Test as my working repository with three files named: README,RUNCOMMAND and Another-file.

Those three files has been committed,linked and pushed to to my GitHub repository called Test as requested in the question.

Only README.txt file contain text since its not mandatory in the question to all files.

Thanks
